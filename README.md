# EE418---ML-project

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/paris-housing-price-prediction/discussion/251171

Dataset was analyzed using 4 different algorithms: Linear regression, lasso, random forest, SVM.

The ML model was supposed to predict the prices of the Paris housing market, however after analysing the dataset it seems that the main correlation with the price is the number of sq. the building has.
After doing backwards elimination analysis we determined that this could be a faulty dataset
